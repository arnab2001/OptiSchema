# üé≠ OptiSchema Demo Guide

This guide will help you run a compelling demo of OptiSchema that showcases its AI-powered PostgreSQL optimization capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Start the Demo Environment
```bash
make demo
```

This command will:
- Start all services (PostgreSQL, Backend API, Frontend)
- Seed the database with realistic demo data
- Create intentional performance bottlenecks
- Make the dashboard ready for demo

### 2. Access the Dashboard
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard**

You should see:
- Live performance metrics
- AI-generated optimization suggestions
- Real-time data updates

---

## üìä Demo Data Overview

The demo environment includes:

### **Database Schema**
- **1,000 users** with realistic profiles and preferences
- **500 products** across 7 categories (Electronics, Clothing, Books, etc.)
- **5,000 orders** with order items and realistic pricing
- **50,000 log entries** for user activity tracking

### **Performance Bottlenecks Created**
1. **Missing Indexes** - Queries on `user_id` without proper indexes
2. **N+1 Query Problems** - Inefficient subqueries in loops
3. **Inefficient Text Search** - LIKE queries on unindexed columns
4. **Complex Aggregations** - Window functions without proper indexes
5. **JSON Query Issues** - JSON operations without GIN indexes

## üéØ Demo Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Dashboard Overview**
**Goal**: Show the main dashboard with live data

**Steps**:
1. Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Point out the "Connected to: optischema" status
3. Show the live metrics with real-time updates
4. Highlight the performance metrics showing slow queries
5. Show the AI-generated suggestions with impact levels

**Key Points**:
- "This dashboard shows real-time performance data from your PostgreSQL database"
- "The AI has identified several optimization opportunities"
- "Each suggestion includes projected performance improvements"

### **Scenario 2: Query Analysis**
**Goal**: Demonstrate detailed query analysis

**Steps**:
1. Click on the "Query Analysis" tab
2. Show the list of slowest queries
3. Click on a query to see detailed analysis
4. Point out the execution plan analysis
5. Show the AI explanation of the performance issue

**Key Points**:
- "This query is taking 2.3 seconds on average"
- "The AI has identified that it's doing a sequential scan"
- "Here's what's causing the performance issue..."

### **Scenario 3: AI Recommendations**
**Goal**: Show AI-generated optimization suggestions

**Steps**:
1. Click on the "Optimizations" tab
2. Show the list of AI-generated suggestions
3. Click on a high-impact suggestion
4. Show the detailed explanation and proposed fix
5. Demonstrate the confidence score and projected savings

**Key Points**:
- "The AI has analyzed your query patterns and identified optimization opportunities"
- "This suggestion has a 95% confidence level"
- "Projected improvement: 80% faster query execution"

### **Scenario 4: Live Query Replay**
**Goal**: Show continuous data generation

**Steps**:
1. Start query replay: `make replay-background`
2. Show how new metrics appear in real-time
3. Point out how the AI adapts to new patterns
4. Show the live indicator pulsing

**Key Points**:
- "The system continuously monitors your database"
- "New performance issues are detected automatically"
- "The AI learns from your query patterns"
