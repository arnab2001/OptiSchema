## 🟢 Phase 0 · Secure, Self-Service Connection
- [x] Build **Connect-DB Wizard** (host, port, db, user, password / URI).
- [x] **Test Connection** button → return clear error (SSL, auth, extension).
- [x] Encrypt & store creds; mask when redisplayed.
- [x] Persist active connection so dashboard reconnects after reload.

---

## 🔍 Phase 1 · Data Quality & "Business Query" Filter
- [x] Exclude framework/system SQL (`pg_stat_%`, `information_schema`, migrations).
- [x] Maintain two lists per refresh: **business queries** vs. **ignored** (show counts).
- [x] Fingerprint queries (strip literals) to de-dupe.
- [x] Add **total execution time** % column to metrics table.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2 · Rich Metrics & Insight Cards
- [x] Capture & display: total_time, mean, p95, rows, shared/temp I/O.
- [x] Badges: **cache-hit %** and **rows read : returned**.
- [x] Replace empty state with progress (*"Waiting for first 50 statements… X/50"*).
- [x] **Sortable metrics table** (SQL · Calls · Avg ms · % Time) with colour badges.
- [x] Tiny **sparklines** of last 5 refreshes next to Avg ms.

---

## 💡 Phase 3 · Actionable Suggestions Only
- [x] Generate suggestions for: missing / unused index, parameterise literals, add LIMIT, increase `work_mem`, adjust `shared_buffers`.
- [x] Impact score badge: High ≥ 25 %, Medium 10-25 %, Low < 10 %.
- [x] Provide concise SQL patch / `ALTER SYSTEM` snippet for each.
- [x] Allow **dismiss** or **snooze**; persist decision.
- [x] Cards in responsive grid; **NaN%** guard — show "—" if value null.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 4 · Patch-Apply & Validation Loop
- [x] Spin up / connect to **sandbox clone** for safe benchmarks.
- [x] "Run Benchmark" flow:  
  1. Measure baseline (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`).  
  2. Apply patch.  
  3. Re-measure, compute delta.  
- [x] Modal shows before/after bar chart; toast with "X % latency drop".
- [x] Store record in **Audit Log** (timestamp, user, query, before, after, status).
- [x] Provide rollback SQL; mark patch as *Applied*.

---

## 🖥️ Phase 5 · UI Polish & Guidance
- [x] Navigation tabs: **Overview · Query Analysis · Optimisations · Audit Log**.
- [x] Query Analysis right-pane:
  - Full SQL with syntax highlight, copy icon.
  - **Analyze Query Performance** button opens plan modal (wire backend).
- [x] Replace long Markdown blocks with **accordion / drawer** details.
- [x] Auto-refresh countdown + timestamp pill on each live card.
- [x] Welcome banner → 8 s toast; Help link persists in header.
- [x] Keyboard nav, dark-mode toggle, mobile stacking & `aria-label`s.

---

## 🛠️ Phase 5.1 · Critical Bug Fixes (do alongside Phase 5)
- [x] Wire **Analyze Query Performance** modal to `/explain`.
- [x] Fix NaN% in savings badges; 0.00 ms → "<0.01 ms".
- [x] Text overflow: add `text-overflow: ellipsis` + tooltip.

---

## 📬 Phase 6 · Notification & Reporting
- [ ] **Static share link** for current suggestions (HTML snapshot).
- [ ] Daily Slack/email digest: top 3 waits + applied fixes.

---

## 🗄️ Phase 7 · Audit & History UI
- [ ] New Audit Log tab → table of all actions (filter by user/date).
- [ ] CSV export button.

---

## 📈 Definition of "Meaningful & Acceptable"
- [x] Users connect any Postgres without editing env vars.
- [x] < 60 s to first ranked business query metric.
- [x] Each suggestion has copy-pastable patch & impact score.
- [x] Benchmarks prove latency drop; all actions logged.
- [x] UI responsive, accessible, dark-mode ready; no broken buttons or NaNs.
